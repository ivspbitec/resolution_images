# resolution_images
Change images src for different screen resolutions 

**Requirements**
* jQuery

**Example**
Put the script in to bottom of your page and use attributes in img tags
<img lg_src="/image_large.jpg" sm_src="/image_middle.jpg" >

At small and large resolutions, src attribute will be replaced on sm_src or lg_src respectively

It can be useful when unavailable to use background images in css and mobile traffic must be reduced.
